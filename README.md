## My process

### Built with

- Mobile First Workflow
- HTML5 Semantic Markup
- BEM
- Sass
- 7-1 Sass Architecture

### What I learned

This project has been quite different compared to the ones I am used to. The design is fairly simple, but the main component is built using HTML and CSS rather than using some prebuilt `.svg`.

Although I have not learned any new CSS rules whilst building this project, I believe I have greatly improved upon my understanding of HTML/Sass architecture, specifically using BEM and Sass partials in order to make the design as composible as possible.
